Installation
============

``ensembldb3`` requires python 3.6+. Until the project is released onto PyPi or conda, you need to install from GitHub.

Installing ``cogent3``
----------------------

Because Cogent3 is also currently only available via GitHub, I have included instructions for installing that also.

    $ DONT_USE_CYTHON=1 pip install git+https://github.com/cogent3/cogent3.git@master#cogent3
